"""Gate: run the mdLite renderer tests under node.

The tests themselves are `tools/test_mdlite.js`, because the thing under test
is JavaScript and a Python re-implementation would only test the
re-implementation. This wrapper exists so the gate has the same interface as
every other one in tools/verify.py, and so a missing `node` is reported
rather than raising `FileNotFoundError` out of verify.py.

node is already required to deploy this site (`npx wrangler deploy`), so it
is not a new dependency — but the suite should still say plainly when a gate
did not run rather than passing quietly.

Ported from the llm-systems-for-data-scientists curriculum, where this
caught a real bug: `**` inside a code span (an exponent, `f**K`) pairing
with a later real `**bold**` marker and bolding across the `<code>`
boundary. This repo's mdLite was already fixed for the equivalent bug
earlier in the same session; this gate is what stops it recurring.
